### 👋 Hey, I'm Matt

I love building things, period. I'm especially drawn to client web and mobile applications, working on design systems, and building UI controls and libraries. 

Right now I'm working at Cetaris, building a suite of Angular web applications. Between that, and renovating every part of my house bit by bit, I play aroud with the React ecosystem and am diving into Dart/Flutter head first.

I'm always looking for a change of scenary or an interesting opportunity, don't be afraid to reach out on any platform. Cheers 🍻
